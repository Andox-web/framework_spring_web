**framework_2624** is a minimalist web framework designed to simplify the creation of dynamic web applications, inspired by Spring MVC concepts while remaining lightweight and flexible. It offers the following features:

- **@Controller**: Annotation to identify classes containing entry points for HTTP requests.
- **@Get**: Annotation for handling HTTP GET requests (additional annotations for POST, PUT, etc., can be added).
- **Front Controller**: Manages incoming requests, identifies the appropriate controller and method, and executes the associated code.
- **Returning Strings**: Controller methods can return raw HTML content.
- **ModelAndView**: Enables returning objects containing model data and JSP views.
- **Package Scanning**: Automatically identifies controller classes within a specified package.

**Quick Start**:

1. Add **Framework.jar** to your project.
2. Create controller classes annotated with **@Controller**, and handle requests with **@Get**.
3. Configure the FrontController in **web.xml**, specifying the controller package, JSP view folder, and view file suffix.

**Key Takeaways**: The framework is basic but extensible, with the potential to add additional features such as form handling and input validation.
